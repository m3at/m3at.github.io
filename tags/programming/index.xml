It turned out to be due to denormal numbers computation on the cpu being much slower than the normal arithmetic. Denormal numbers are very low magnitude floats, treated differently to keep precision.
For deep learning, those are largely below significance and can be flushed to zero without accuracy loss. To do so for example in PyTorch, either set the appropriate flag: torch.</description></item><item><title>Space filling curves and CNN</title><link>/post/space-filling-curves-and-transformer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 11:59:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/space-filling-curves-and-transformer/</guid><description>üë∑üèª this is a work in progress üîß
Sometimes by exploring incongruous ideas, one can make interesting discoveries. This is know as serendipity in science, with penicillin being a famous example of an unplanned discovery.
What I experimented with this week-end‚Ä¶ is no such case. üòÖ
In the spirit of not holding back negative results though, and for the unlikely possibility that it turns out helpful for someone, I&amp;rsquo;ll share it regardless!</description></item><item><title>Creating a static blog, the convoluted way</title><link>/post/creating-a-static-blog-the-convoluted-way/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 06:16:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/creating-a-static-blog-the-convoluted-way/</guid><description>TLDR: I wanted to create a static blog while being able to type articles from a nice UI, from anywhere. It is quite straightforward with forestry + hugo + github pages. Jump to the solution.
Motivation If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to create a blog, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck! There are countless tools to help you get up and running in a few minutes. For example Hugo will generate a static site from a few markdown files, and pushing it to github in a repository named YOUR_USERNAME.</description></item></channel></rss>
