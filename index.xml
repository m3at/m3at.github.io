I grew up in France and moved to Japan for my first job. I started as a programmer, mainly for tasks centered on machine learning, and recently moved into project and team managements.
I enjoy talking about machine learning, programming, sysadmin and life in Japan.
Though I can&amp;rsquo;t promise to reply immediately, feel free to contact me. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to talk to you!</description></item></channel></rss>
